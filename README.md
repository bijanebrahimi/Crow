Crow
====
[**crow**](https://github.com/bijanebrahimi/crow) is a StatusNet microblogging client. I decided not to stick with [other clients](http://federation.skilledtests.com/Statusnet_clients.html) just because i needed one which can be easy contribute to and fast to grow and lots of crazy features. I chose `HTML` and `javascript` for it's user interface since it's very flexible and `python` for a small web server which acts as a proxy between the user interface and a statusnet federated server. Currently it lacks the library to run the interface independently (definitely webkit) so it needs to be run on a web browser like an web application.

Version
---------------
You can get [current stable version](https://github.com/bijanebrahimi/crow) or [develop version](https://github.com/bijanebrahimi/crow/tree/develop) which has no version, just the bleeding edge code which I strongly recommend it to use since the entire code is still beta and unstable and developing version contains up to date bug fixes and new features.


Current Version
---------------
0.3.develop-2


Installing dependencies
---------------

Crow contains a small web server written in *python 2.7+* and uses the pyhton tornado library.  The rest is HTML and Javascript.

In Debian/Ubuntu friends:

        sudo apt-get install python-pip python-notify
        sudo pip install tornado

In Fedora:

        sudo yum install python-pip python-notify
        sudo python-pip install tornado

In Windows; thanks to @[shabgard](http://quitter.se/shabgard):

1. Get Python 2.x from Phython.org and install it
2. Get distribute from http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py and install it by executing it.
3. Get pip from https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py and istall it like distribute.
4. Install tornado using 

        $ pip install tornado

**Note**: installing `python-notify` is optional since it only gets loaded when available

In OSX:

The easiest way is to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and then use Homebrew to install python. 

To install Homebrew: 

	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

Then insert the Homebrew directory in your PATH environment variable of  ~/.bashrc:

	export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

Now install Python:

	$ brew install python

Then add the new Python scripts directory to your PATH environment variable of  ~/.bashrc:

	export PATH=/usr/local/share/python:$PATH

Now python is installed install tornado: 

	$ pip install tornado

If `Git` tools aren't installed already download the latest [Git installer package](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3), double click on the installer to start the installation wizard. You wil be prompted for your system password in order for the installer to complete.


Get the code
---------------

### Download

to get the latest code, you can download the source code from either the [stable version](https://github.com/bijanebrahimi/crow) or the [developing version](https://github.com/bijanebrahimi/crow/tree/develop).

### Git Clone

I suggest you to clone the project on your computer which makes the future updates very easy:

        mkdir crow-src
        cd crow-src
        git clone https://github.com/bijanebrahimi/Crow.git ./
        git checkout develop

the last git command switches to `develop` branch which. To use the stable version (for instance after an update has caused instability) you can run

	git checkout master 

at anytime.


Run
---------------

Crow uses html as GUI so you need to run it in your browser. 
First you need to run the server.

        chmod +x run.py
        ./run.py

Now you can open the `http://127.0.0.1:8888/` address in your web browser. Browsers such as `google Chrome` or `firefox`
(`chromium` and `iceweasel` are the Free versions of these browsers) provide possibility to
view a web page in an application mode which is ideal for our job.

* in Google Chrome: `chromium --app=http://127.0.0.1:8888/`
* in Firefox: `firefox -P Default --no-remote -width 380 -height 700 -chromehttp://127.0.0.1:8888/`

Remember not to close the terminal you ran Crow from as that will stop the Crow process.


Configuration
---------------

* `API_PATH` which is necessary for statusnet federal instances.
edit `config.py` and change the api path to your statusnet instance api path.
read [this manual](http://status.net/wiki/API_discovery) to find out what your api path should change to.

        API_PATH = 'http://quitter.se/api/'

* `SRV_PORT` which is the port crow will be listening on it. change it to
any port number that is open

        SRV_PORT = 8888

* `CRW_NOTIFY_PUBLICS` which will turn off notification for public notices when **False**

* `CRW_NOTIFY_MAXIMUM` which will limit number of notifies in one go. zero means unlimited


Update
---------------

To update to your Crow installation make sure you are in the folder you originally copied the Crow files to (crow-src in the instructions above) and run

	git pull origin
